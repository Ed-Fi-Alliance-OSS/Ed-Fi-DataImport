These JSON files are the result of fetching Swagger metadata from a development instance of the ODS v2.5.0.1.
They are meant to be a representative sample of the metatdata that the Data Import tool works against,
though naturally metadata may vary for other versions and customizations. These files were collected
by saving the individual responses fetched while saving on the Configuration screen.

Swagger-Resources-Api-Docs.json is the "root" Resources document found by hitting ODS URI:

   /metadata/resources/api-docs

Swagger-Descriptors-Api-Docs.json is the "root" Descriptors document found by hitting ODS URI:

   /metadata/descriptors/api-docs

The remaining files come from the entity-by-entity metadata found by hitting ODS URIs:

   /metadata/resources/api-docs/academicWeeks
   /metadata/resources/api-docs/accounts
   ...
   /metadata/resources/api-docs/studentTitleIPartAProgramAssociations
   /metadata/descriptors/api-docs/termDescriptors

This well-known representative set of metadata is used by tests in order to uncover realistic complications
that would be missed by too-simple test cases against mocked up metadata.
